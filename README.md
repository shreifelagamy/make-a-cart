# make-a-cart

### Description

You are tasked with creating a simple cart class, which should have basic implementation of a typical cart.

You will be using TDD which is already setup for you, you have 2 folders:

- `src`: Where you will write your code.
- `tests`: Where the cart test is unit tested.

If you are not familair with TDD or unit testing you should google it, to understand the basics.

### Setup

- Run `composer install` to install the dependencies.
- Run `composer dump-autoload` to generate the autoload file.
- Run `phpunit tests` or `vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit tests` to run the tests.

### Approach

First you must read the `tests/CartTest.php` file very well, it contains the required test cases, read those test cases to figure out which methods to implement for your Cart.

### Results

If your implementation is correct, phpunit will report with green status in your console, otherwise red flags will be displayed describing the errors, there is no specification on how to implement each method, it is all up to you.
